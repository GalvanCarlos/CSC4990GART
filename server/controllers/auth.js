//this file should contain all the controller funtions for the User collection(db table)
//that way we can implement a CRUD ready structure 

//create --> create user account (a version can be found in the routes folder)
//read --> displays user data; useful for login and for other
//update --> updates the user info; corralates with an 'account' page on the front end side (tba)
//delete user --->deletes user from collection permanantly; standard practice for all websites
